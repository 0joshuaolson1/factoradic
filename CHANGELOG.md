## 1.1.0 from 1.0.0

Removed ES6 requirement. Added `pton` and `ntop`. Improved documentation. Added `test` return value and failure information.

MAJOR RELEASE, ACTUALLY: Changed `aton` to use a bigint `zero` instead of a `nctor` constuctor.

^ But nobody was really using 1.0.0. I still need to fix this with a release that includes this changelog...
